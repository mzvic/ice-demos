# Camera project with ICE

- This is a basic project where you can take a photo just sending the command 't' in client.py
  
- The photo will be saved as 'filename.jpg'
  
- For every device you need to change the name of the camera, in this case, the name of the camera is 'FaceTime HD Video'
  
- You need to install pygame to make this project work
  - pip3 install pygame
